        <h2>What Is Debt, and Why It’s Important to Understand It Early</h2>
        <p>Debt is money borrowed that must be repaid, often with interest. Understanding debt early is crucial because it influences your financial decisions and long-term financial health. Knowing how to manage debt can prevent financial stress and help you use borrowing to your advantage rather than letting it become a burden.</p>
        
        <h2>Understanding Credit</h2>
        <p>Credit involves borrowing money with the promise to repay it later, often through credit cards, loans, or other forms of borrowing. Understanding how credit works, including the impact of interest rates and repayment terms, is essential for managing debt effectively and maintaining a good credit score.</p>
        
        <h2>Good vs. Bad Debt</h2>
        <p>Debt can be categorized into good and bad debt. Good debt typically includes investments that generate income or appreciate in value, such as student loans or mortgages. Bad debt includes high-interest debt used for non-essential purchases. Understanding the difference helps in making informed borrowing decisions and managing debt responsibly.</p>
        
        <h2>Building and Managing Credit</h2>
        <p>Building a positive credit history involves timely repayment of debts, maintaining low credit card balances, and monitoring credit reports regularly. Good credit management is crucial for securing favorable loan terms and achieving financial goals. Developing good credit habits early sets the foundation for a strong financial future.</p>
        
        <h2>Avoiding Debt Traps</h2>
        <p>Debt traps occur when borrowing spirals out of control, leading to financial difficulties. Avoiding debt traps involves understanding loan terms, avoiding excessive borrowing, and paying off high-interest debt as quickly as possible. Being aware of common debt traps helps prevent financial stress and maintains financial stability.</p>
