        <h2>Financial Planning for Teens</h2>
        <p>Financial planning is an important skill for teens, preparing them for future financial responsibilities. Understanding how to set goals, budget, and save early helps build a strong foundation for financial independence. Learning these skills early equips teens to handle their finances effectively as they transition into adulthood.</p>
        
        <h2>Setting Financial Goals</h2>
        <p>Setting clear financial goals helps teens focus on what they want to achieve. Goals can range from saving for a new gadget to planning for college expenses.

        <h2>Building an Emergency Fund</h2>

        <h2>Understanding Insurance</h2>
        <p>Insurance is a key component of financial planning, providing protection against risks and uncertainties.

Knowledge of insurance helps teens make informed decisions about coverage and financial protection.</p>
        
        <h2>Saving for the Future</h2>
        <p>Saving for the future, whether for college or other long-term goals, is crucial for financial planning.
